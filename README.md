Hello! My name is Jesse O. Dolla. I am from KCA University taking a course in BS Information Technology.

My interests in the technology space are full stack software development and cybersecurity leaning on the side of Intelligence gathering. I am currently studying C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I would love to join different communitites and projects that challenge the basic ideas of problem solving in the Tech community with an aim to diversify solutions and grow an already existing knowledge base.
